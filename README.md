# pypush
`pypush` is a POC demo of my recent iMessage reverse-engineering.
It can currently register as a new device on an Apple ID, set up encryption keys, and ***send and receive iMessages***!

`pypush` is completely platform-independent, and does not require a Mac or other Apple device to use!

## Installation
1. `git clone https://github.com/JJTech0130/pypush.git`
2. `cd pypush`
3. `pip install -e ./apns`
4. `pip install -e .`
